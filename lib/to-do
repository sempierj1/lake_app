add uninvite functionality

Change db listener in menu to maybe listen under users displayname instead of just users (user/josh sempier) otherwise it'll be a lot of overhead.

once logged in check DB for user (need to set display name still somehow) and then check DB for their family members and mark verified

Going to need to use member# as part of displayname
