Switch Sign-In main page to the checkInQueue view but add a floating button to check someone in the old badge number way (maybe just ignore the family list since no one cares)
Have it take badge number in dialog, search, pop, display new dialog with list of family members? and textarea for number of people to be entered and submit.

Need to figure out security fix though because it would be bypassing the pictures.
